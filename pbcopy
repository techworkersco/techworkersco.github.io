[**He Got Game (Album Version) Public Enemy&nbsp;1988**](https://genius.com/Public-enemy-he-got-game-album-version-lyrics)
  
_Amongst the fiends controlled by the screens  _
_What does it all mean, all this shit I'm seein'?  _
_...  _
_Folks don't even own themselves  _
_Payin mental rent, to corporate presidents  _
_...  _
_Aiyo, these are some serious times that we're livin in G  _
_And a new world order is about to begin, you know what I'm sayin?&nbsp;&nbsp;  _
_Now the question is - are you ready, for the real revolution  _
_Which is the evolution of the mind?  _
_If you seek then you shall find that we all come from the divine_
