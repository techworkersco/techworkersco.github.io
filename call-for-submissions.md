We’re here to hear your story, help you write it, and use it. We’ll work with you to publish your workers’ perspective in 800–1,600 words. Our aim is to change tech workplaces and the industry in collaboration with the people and communities it impacts.

### What we publish

- Your personal story and experience with fellow workers and collective action
- Perspectives on organizing from underrepresented, undervalued tech workers
- Narratives that are critical of power and put tech labor in historical context
- Accounts of collaboration and solidarity across ‘workplaces’ in the ‘gig’ economy

### What we don’t publish

- Impersonal essays or intellectual commentary not based on experience
- Press releases by corporate nonprofit staff or campaign consultants
