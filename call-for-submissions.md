<mark>We work closely with you to put your workers’ perspective in writing, 200 to 1,200 words.</mark> It's as much about the process and relationship as it is about the product we publish. We do this in service of our editorial vision:

- Building critical consciousness of workers as a class with shared interests.
- Sharing stories based on worker experience educating, organizing, and collective action in tech.
- Challenging the industry’s dominant culture of individualism and its acceptance of gross inequality.
- Situating ourselves in the history of labor organizing, both within the industry and beyond it.
- Emphasizing the importance of solidarity with all workers.

### What we publish

<mark>We welcome a variety of content from the workers' perspective:</mark>

- Original writing on topics we care about and can only address collectively.
- News of tech worker organizing from around the globe, particularly efforts with grassroots leadership.
- Perspectives from underrepresented tech workers about their experiences in the industry and what they see as its failures.
- Analysis of what can be achieved through building collective power, contextualized within the long legacy of labor organizing in similar fields.
- Rebuttals to common anti-organizing sentiments, like the idea that "someone else will build it" (they might not!).
- Accounts of solidarity between different types of tech workers.

<a href="/archive/">Previous issues</a> have included a range of perspectives from tech workers:

- Agonizing about framing anti-oppression organizing as ‘diversity training’ in tech.
- Weighing quitting a union job at a water treatment plant for a solar power co-op.
- Running study groups with other temps, vendors, and contractors &mdash; and then organizing.
- Conducting a six-month study on the ties between tech companies and the military, scraping data on 100,000+ contracts.

In addition to personal stories, we also welcome creative alternatives &mdash; for example:

- A BuzzFeed quiz to see if you’re under surveillance.
- A Yelp! review of tech union campaigns.
- The rare tale of actually using ‘unlimited’ paid time off.
- Some kind of checklist for making algorithms slightly less racist.
- A data scraping tool and newsfeed of company involvement with the military that helps inform overeager recruiters who they really work for.

### What we don’t publish

We prioritize the workers' perspective and working people representing themselves.

Here are some examples of content we typically reject:

- Critiques of tech imperialism, capitalism, injustice, etc. &mdash; or proposals for alternatives &mdash; that are not based on your lived experience.
- Abstract or niche commentaries that lack a universal theme like work, working conditions, or solidarity beyond the workplace.
- Narratives from corporate nonprofit staff or campaign consultants, not from workers.
- Anything that reads like a press release or impersonal op-ed.
- General commentary on labor or the economy that doesn’t relate to the tech industry.

### How to submit

If you can share something with your fellow workers, we help you figure out a good story and strategy.

Here’s how to start the process:

1. Email us your rough ideas or pitches to [twcnewsletter@protonmail.com](mailto:twcnewsletter@protonmail.com)!
1. We’ll reach out to start a conversation.
1. Then, we’ll help you get a first draft together, usually in a phone call.
1. We’ll also discuss and decide with you how to handle anonymity and other security considerations.
1. Depending on the story and strategy, we’ll move it fast or to give it more time.
1. Finally, we publish the piece! Our newsletters currently comes out every other Friday.


### Other ways to contribute

In addition to workers’ perspective, we welcome collaborators who can help with news, history, and songs. We also could use more eyes on proofreading and more hands pushing 'publish' each week! Engaging more collaborators is how we ensure the stewardship of this project for the long-term. Sound interesting to you? [Email us](mailto:twcnewsletter@protonmail.com)!
