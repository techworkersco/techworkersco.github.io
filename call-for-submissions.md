**This open call is for you!**

<p class="lead" markdown="1">
Our editorial collective would love to hear your story and help you write. We’ve been publishing a newsletter with workers’ perspectives since May 1, 2020, moving at the speed of trust and building reliable processes &mdash; you can read more in [our about page](/about/).

We're excited to share this open call for contributors and collaborators.

<mark>We’ll work closely with you to put your workers’ perspective in writing, 200-1,200 words. It's as much about the process and relationship as it is about the product we publish. We do this in service of our editorial vision:</mark>

- Building critical consciousness of workers as a class with shared interests.
- Sharing stories based on worker experience educating, organizing, and collective action in tech.
- Challenging the industry’s dominant culture of individualism and its acceptance of gross inequality.
- Situating ourselves in the history of labor organizing, both within the industry and beyond it.
- Emphasizing the importance of solidarity with all workers.

### What we publish

<mark>Overall, we like to include a variety of content in the newsletter:</mark>

- Original writing on topics we care about and can only address collectively.
- News of tech worker organizing from around the globe, particularly efforts with grassroots leadership.
- Perspectives from underrepresented tech workers about their experiences in the industry and what they see as its failures.
- Analysis of what could be achieved through building collective power, contextualized within the long legacy of labor organizing in similar fields.
- Rebuttals to common anti-organizing sentiments, like the idea that "someone else will build it" (they might not!).
- Accounts of solidarity between different types of tech workers.

<mark><a href="/archive/">Previous issues</a> have included a range of perspectives from tech workers:</mark>

- Agonizing about framing anti-oppression organizing as ‘diversity training’ in tech.
- Weighing quitting a union job at a water treatment plant for a solar power co-op.
- Running study groups with other temps, vendors, and contractors &mdash; and then organizing.
- Conducting a six-month study on the ties between tech companies and the military, scraping data on 100,000+ contracts.

<mark>In addition to your own work experience, we also welcome creative alternatives &mdash; for example:</mark>

- A BuzzFeed quiz to see if you’re under surveillance.
- A Yelp! review of tech union campaigns.
- The rare tale of actually using ‘unlimited’ paid time off.
- Some kind of checklist for making algorithms slightly less racist.
- A data scraping tool and newsfeed of company involvement with the military that helps inform overeager recruiters who they really work for.

### What we don’t publish

We prioritize the workers' perspective.

<mark>Here are some examples of content we typically reject:</mark>

- Critiques of tech imperialism, capitalism, injustice, etc. &mdash; or proposals for alternatives &mdash; that are not based on your lived experience.
- Abstract or niche commentaries that lack a universal theme like work, working conditions, or solidarity beyond the workplace.
- Narratives from corporate nonprofit staff or campaign consultants, not from workers.
- Anything that reads like a press release or impersonal op-ed.
- General commentary on labor or the economy that doesn’t relate to the tech industry.

### How to submit

If you have an urge to talk about your experience, we’re here to help you figure out your best story and strategy.
