Our editorial collective exists to help workers talk with each other and share their story. Our aim is to change tech workplaces and the industry in collaboration with the workers and communities it impacts. We work with you to publish your worker’s perspective, roughly 800–1,600 words. 

### What we publish

- Narratives by underrepresented or undervalued tech workers
- Personal stories of organizing and collective action with fellow workers
- First-person analysis that puts direct experience in historical context
- Interviews with peers and coworkers across ‘workplaces’, in the ‘gig’ economy, and beyond
- Accounts of building worker power for refusal, abolition, and building alternatives
 
### What we don’t publish

- Impersonal essays or commentary not based on experience
- Press releases by corporate nonprofit staff or campaign consultants
