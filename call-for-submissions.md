Our editorial collective would love to hear your story and help you write. Since May 1, 2020, we’ve been publishing a newsletter with worker’s perspectives, moving at the speed of trust and building reliable processes &mdash; read more in [our about page](/about/). Now, we're excited to share this open call for contributors and collaborators.
</p>
</div>

We'll help you put your worker’s perspective in writing, 200 to 1,200 words. It's as much about the process and relationship as it is about the product we publish.

We do this in service of our editorial vision for this newsletter:

- Building critical consciousness of workers as a class with shared interests.
- Situating ourselves in the history of labor organizing, both within the industry and beyond it.
- Sharing personal stories based on our experience educating, organizing, and collective action in tech.
- Challenging the industry’s dominant culture of individualism and its acceptance of gross inequality.
- Emphasizing the importance of solidarity with all workers.

### What we publish

We welcome a variety of contributions from the worker's perspective:

- Original writing on struggles in tech and what can be achieved through collective action.
- Stories that you can use to help make sense of a situation, or as a resource for your organizing with coworkers.
- Insight on specific experiences like a first one-on-one, or general topics like escalating demands.
- Accounts of solidarity between different types of tech workers.
- Analysis contextualized within the long legacy of labor organizing in other sectors.
- Rebuttals to common anti-organizing sentiments, like the idea that "someone else will build this weapon" (they might not!).

Who we prioritize:

- Underrepresented tech workers and their experiences in the tech industry and what they see as its failures.
- Workers in tech organizing with grassroots leadership, especially in communities far from Silicon Valley and around the world.

<a href="/archive/">Previous issues</a> have included a range of perspectives from tech workers:

- Agonizing about framing anti-oppression organizing as ‘diversity training’ in tech.
- Weighing quitting a union job at a water treatment plant for a solar power co-op.
- Running study groups with other temps, vendors, and contractors &mdash; and then organizing.
- Evaluating eight years as a designer in tech, escaping cultural and financial startup traps along the way.
- Conducting a six-month study on the ties between tech companies and the military, scraping data on 100,000+ contracts.

In addition to personal stories, we also welcome creative alternatives &mdash; for example:

- A BuzzFeed quiz to see if you’re under surveillance.
- A Yelp! review of tech union campaigns.
- The rare tale of actually using ‘unlimited’ paid time off.
- Some kind of checklist for making algorithms slightly less racist.
- A data scraping tool and newsfeed of company involvement with the military that helps inform overeager recruiters who they really work for.

### What we don’t publish

We prioritize the worker's perspective and working people representing themselves.

Here are some examples of content we typically reject:

- Impersonal op-eds that are not based on lived experience.
- Broad, sweeping critiques of tech imperialism, capitalism, injustice, etc.
- Press releases from campaign consultants or corporate nonprofit staff who are not rank-and-file workers.
- Narratives about projects that are more about the solution than the struggle of organizaing or collective action.
- Niche commentaries that lack a universal theme like work, working conditions, or solidarity beyond the workplace.

### More ways to contribute

In addition to worker’s perspective, we welcome collaborators who can help with news, history, and songs. We also could use more eyes on proofreading and more hands pushing 'publish' each week! Including more collaborators is how we ensure the stewardship of this project for the long-term.
