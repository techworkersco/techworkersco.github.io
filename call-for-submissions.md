### What we publish

We welcome a variety of contributions from the worker's perspective:

- Your personal story and experience with fellow workers and collective action
- Perspectives on organizing from underrepresented, undervalued tech workers
- Narratives that are critical of power and put tech labor in historical context
- Accounts of collaboration and solidarity across ‘workplaces’ in the ‘gig’ economy

### What we don’t publish

- Impersonal essays or intellectual commentary not based on experience
- Press releases by corporate nonprofit staff or campaign consultants
