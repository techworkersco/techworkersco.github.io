# Process

*Our step-by-step publishing checklist*

## :calendar: Schedule

We operate in the [Pacific Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone) (UTC-8:00 or UTC-7:00).

We publish new issues bi-weekly, **every other Friday at 11:00 AM**. This includes publishing the new issue to the website, sending an email to our mailing list, and tweeting a link to the new issue.

We hold a **weekly Tuesday meeting at 3:00 PM** to check-in, collaborate, discuss updates, make decisions, etc.

## :snowflake: Roles

There are a few different areas of responsibility for each issue. Who does what is determined during weekly meetings, over emails, and chat. Some responsibilities are **collective**. :busts_in_silhouette:

#### Publisher

Each issue has two "leads" or publishers. We rotate this responsibility per issue.

- Informal "point of contact" that ensures everything above gets done
- Responsible for opening, managing, and merging the final pull request on GitHub

#### Editorial

 - Supporting and guiding Worker's Perspective contributors (TBA)
 - Identifying major themes in the news (TBA)
 - Title and blurb (**everyone** :busts_in_silhouette:)
 - Proofreading and editing (**everyone** :busts_in_silhouette:)

#### Content

- Worker's Perspective (TBA)
- News (**everyone** :busts_in_silhouette:)
- History (TBA)
- Song (contributor or **everyone** :busts_in_silhouette:)
