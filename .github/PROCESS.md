# Process

*Our step-by-step publishing checklist*

> :bulb: **Need to create a new issue?** [Learn how here](https://github.com/techworkersco/techworkersco.github.io/blob/master/.github/DOCUMENTATION.md#generating-a-new-issue).

## :moon: Contributor

Our overall process is oriented around contributors. Here's how it works:

1. Email pitch - a story or narrative from the worker's perspective
1. Chat live - see one other, and become friends! We discuss the pitch, starting with desired outcome for the contributor from writing/publishing and ending with editorial vision alignment. We also set expectations: the full writing and editing process may involve multiple rounds of drafting/editing, and 2-5 hours
1. Submit first draft - no fewer than 10 days before publishing, to give time and space for editing
1. Chat live again - big questions (contributor's desired outcome, editorial vision alignment) and small details (anonymity, cover image, blurb, title, etc.)
1. Submit final draft - no fewer than 5 days before publishing, to get perspective from new eyes to ensure draft feels in alignment
1. Approve proofreading - no fewer than 2 days before publishing
1. Publish!

## :calendar: Schedule

We operate in the [Pacific Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone) (UTC-8:00 or UTC-7:00).

We publish new issues roughly bi-weekly. (Though there are some exceptions.) This includes publishing the new issue to the website, sending an email to our mailing list, and tweeting a link to the new issue.

## :snowflake: Roles

There are a few different areas of responsibility for each issue. Who does what is determined during weekly meetings, over emails, and chat. Some responsibilities are **collective**. :busts_in_silhouette:

#### Publisher

Each issue has two "leads" or publishers. We rotate this responsibility per issue.

- Informal "point of contact" that ensures everything above gets done
- Responsible for opening, managing, and merging the final pull request on GitHub

#### Editorial

 - Supporting and guiding Worker's Perspective contributors (TBA)
 - Identifying major themes in the news (TBA)
 - Title and blurb (**everyone** :busts_in_silhouette:)
 - Proofreading and editing (**everyone** :busts_in_silhouette:)

#### Content

- Worker's Perspective (TBA)
- News (**everyone** :busts_in_silhouette:)
- History (TBA)
- Song (contributor or **everyone** :busts_in_silhouette:)
