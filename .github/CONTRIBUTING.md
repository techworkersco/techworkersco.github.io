## Editorial

#### Content and format:

- Making sense of “what this moment means,” focusing on worker organizing to overcome challenges, the root causes of those challenges, or both.
- Curated items we’re reading, highlighting contributions from around the world.
- Historic perspective on past moments and trends in tech and labor organizing, especially those that are less known or missing in the Bay Area or US.
- Song about labor or tech with a link and an excerpt from the lyrics.
- Shareable: I hope we write articles that workers want to share with each other, and that this newsletter is another avenue of radicalization

#### Qualities to strive for:

- Interesting and enjoyable - our subscribers look forward to reading each issue.
- Approachable - for tech workers who are unfamiliar with labor history or radical politics.
- Timely and relevant - useful for making sense in the moment, and taking action.
- Comprehensive - readers should feel that we’ve covered the important news.
Succinct.

#### Voice:

- Committed and confident.
- Friendly and optimistic where possible.
- Not overly aggressive.
- Thoughtful, well-reasoned, and persuasive, without guilting or brow-beating the reader.
- The real deal: What workers say when the bosses aren’t listening
