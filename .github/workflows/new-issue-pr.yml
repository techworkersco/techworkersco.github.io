            # Checklist

            - [ ] Add initial draft content to the issue template.
            - [ ] Upload the header image and any other images. (The bot will comment with an upload link.)
                - [ ] :warning: **Name the header image correctly** before uploading. Near the top of the template, you'll find the expected name. It should look something like `vol-3-issue-1-header.jpg`. Make sure the file name and extension match the template. Update the template if needed, for example, if you are uploading a `png` instead.
                - [ ] Once all images are uploaded, add the `needs optimize images` label.
                - [ ] The bot will optimize the images and push the changes here.
                - [ ] If you modify images again, remove and re-add the `needs optimize images` label to re-trigger the bot.

            > :label: Sometimes the automated checks get stuck after the bot optimizes images. If that happens, just edit the issue again to re-trigger the checks. (Simply adding a blank line is enough.)

            - [ ] Continue editing and proofreading the issue.
                - [ ] The bot :robot: is your friend. Fix any issues that it comments about.
                - [ ] Make corrections suggested by the prose checker, if desired. (The bot will comment with issues found.)

            - [ ] The pull request is initially marked as a **draft**. Click **Ready For Review** below.
            - [ ] Make any final edits.
            - [ ] **Approve** the pull request when finished. :white_check_mark: But, **do not merge**.

            > :warning: Subsequent edits will **void** approval. **You will need to re-approve after any edits**. Thus, it is recommended to approve only once the issue is completely finished.

            - [ ] Verify that **all checks are passing**. :white_check_mark:
                - [ ] If status checks are failing, click "Details" next to the failing check. Read the logs and try to address the issue(s).
            - [ ] Add the `auto-publish` label. The bot will then merge this [automatically tomorrow morning](https://github.com/techworkersco/techworkersco.github.io/blob/master/.github/DOCUMENTATION.md#auto-publish-label)!

            Nice work, champ. :sunglasses: You're finished!
