Today, we learned that Google [will not renew its AI contract with the Department of Defense](https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620), after months of employee-led opposition. Over 4,000 Google workers signed an internal petition to cancel the project, and the Tech Workers Coalition [launched our own petition on CoWorker.org](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/tech-should-not-be-in-the-business-of-war), followed by an [open letter from the academic community](https://www.icrac.net/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and-tech-workers/) with over 1,000 signatures.

**To the Google workers and allies who fought for this** , we extend infinite love and solidarity. To employees of Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and any others who may be facing a similar situation: you're not alone. Collective action can work. Let's get organized.**_Yesterday in San Francisco, image from [‏@FitzTheReporter](https://twitter.com/FitzTheReporter/status/1002252990978211840)_


### Worker's Perspective

_We spoke to [Lisa "Tiny" Grey Garcia](https://twitter.com/PovertySkola?lang=en), from [Poor Magazine](http://www.poormagazine.org/), an independent media network originally in San Francisco but displaced to deep East Oakland. Tiny shares:_  
  
We serve the people. We had 4 days of action this week: We marched from San Jose&nbsp;to Google, and yesterday we were in San Francisco&nbsp;where we led a symbolic act on the rampant tech gentrification in the Bay Area.&nbsp;Our action yesterday was about highlighting our work to develop a&nbsp;[tech&nbsp;reparations&nbsp;fund](https://www.gofundme.com/landless-peoples-land-housing), a&nbsp;grassroots community pot to rebuild equity that's been stolen. At times the stealing happens indirectly and people may not be aware they've benefitted from structural privilege — but folks&nbsp;need to realize the impact it has on&nbsp;the community through removal and displacement. We say and will continue to say: **Let's do something about it.**  
  
Conscious tech folk need to step up and give to those who've been evicted through gentrification. The money in the fund will&nbsp;go to those getting displaced in Temescal, and a Black martial arts center in Oakland; we're supporting three families right now facing eviction. We're trying to get them something — a car, apartment, anything.&nbsp;  
  
_ **We know the aristocracy and those with privilege will tell you there's a right and wrong way to protest.** _ Some tech elites would prefer if the protests happened at City Hall so they wouldn't have to see it. But that's not the answer and to tech workers of&nbsp;conscience, I would say: **Don't let the aristocracy&nbsp;reduce what's going on, they want to reduce and destroy.&nbsp;As folks are waking up, we need to build a stronger shield, staying in truth and walking in liberation.** _
