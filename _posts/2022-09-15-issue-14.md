### What do workers today need to learn from elders to guide future organizing?

Workers in tech are, and have always been, historical actors, but learning from history can be challenging. In a fast-paced industry, even the past few years can feel inaccessible. We hope to change that with this first intergenerational teach-in event. 

On October 19-21, we’re bringing together elder and younger workers in and around tech to share perspectives and learn skills for organizing, solidarity, and healing. By situating worker perspectives and collective actions in history, we’ll all be better equipped to face the demands of today’s workplaces and organize for the future ahead.

We’d love to see you there!
