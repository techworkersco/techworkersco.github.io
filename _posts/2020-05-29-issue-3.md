My mom calls me a protest baby. She's a refugee who realized early that the only way to get what your community needs is to fight for it. As her only child, I banked a lifetime attending marches, [publishing](http://www.thirdwomanpress.com/) queer feminist writing, and organizing [community schools](https://vietunity.wordpress.com/hai-ba-trung/) that teach activists how to canvass and campaign. I planned to spend my professional life teaching, [writing](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/transformative-justice-explained) about, and building movements that resist the alchemy of racism and capitalism. But two years ago, after UC Berkeley fastened the magical letters Ph.D. to the end of my name, I floundered. Facing high housing costs, endless student loan payments, and a saturated academic job market, I made a choice: I came back to anti-oppression [consulting](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-tran-ph-d-546439a9) and expanded my client base to include tech.

I've had my practice for twelve years. When I started, we called it "cultural literacy training." Then it became "anti-oppression work." Now, a lot of what I do falls under the umbrella of "diversity, equity and inclusion." On a daily basis, I am in rooms asking marginalized employees what makes it hard for them to do their work. Amidst the smell of stale coffee and bad carpet, a trans employee of color might tell me that they're tokenized by their manager. A common refrain is, "My white managers have no idea how to receive feedback from people that look like me." I fill these gaps with allyship trainings and by writing progressive employee policies. I troubleshoot other problems with pipelines and workplace culture. Over more than a decade, my good days have been defined by a combination of curiosity and humility. The best ones include someone asking me, "What should I do when I'm inadvertently racist?" There are also bad days.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion is a crowded field. It mainly consists of lawyers, human resource managers, and other corporate professionals. In my experience, only a small handful of these folks have either a deep well of knowledge or a commitment to uprooting systemic causes of oppression. This is why many focus on expanding recruiting pools or bettering their respective brands instead of dismantling capitalism. And because tech traffics in transplants, even fewer have felt the pain associated with the churn of their industry in the Bay Area. But I have.

I grew up in a part of San Jose called Alum Rock, 17 minutes away from the Apple Campus in Cupertino. Asian supermarkets sit next to taquerias, Vietnamese sandwich shops and tiny storefronts selling tofu. Everyone kind of looks like me, Southeast Asian or brown. Most folks are trying to make it. Despite being only thirteen miles away from Apple, no one in my family of over forty people has ever worked there. Here, hating tech is a religion and I am a devout follower. Tech is a dirty word, a euphemism for gentrification and poverty; the rationale for a lot of people's pain. This is something I [write about](https://rewire.news/article/2017/10/24/neighbors-look-like-alien-women-gentrification/), [tweet about](https://twitter.com/but_im_kim_tran/status/1259207531982811137), and talk about. [Google's aggressive expansion](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Google-proposes-master-plan-for-San-Jose-14511528.php) in a town where home values average [$1.13 million](https://www.zillow.com/research/hottest-housing-markets-2018-17852/) and rent for a studio [hovers above $2,000 per month](https://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/most-expensive-cities-for-renters/). On bad days, I remember my hometown and struggle to imagine how helping tech diversify its employee base, or decrease microaggressions, is anything other than putting lipstick on a pig.

I often feel trapped by my job.

The organizer in me knows I'm not doing enough to address the root causes of oppression; that my sheer existence assuages the liberal guilt associated with tech. On the other hand, I offer a slightly more level playing field: a voice for the people who are always spoken over in a meeting, passed over for a promotion, invited for an interview. I am making the workplace a little better for queer people of color like me.

So. How do I reconcile years studying the pernicious effects of racial capitalism, only to become a part of the machine that disenfranchises my community? How do I reconcile fighting how tech harms people with taking its paychecks? How do I reconcile a lifetime spent hating tech with seeing an actual billionaire face to face? The short answer: I don't.

For two years I have agonized over my involvement with tech. I have sat with and opened myself up to the harm that I've caused. I do not write myself off as privileged, or denigrate myself as powerless within late capitalism. Both are reductive ways to dismiss how power actually operates. Instead, I've asked myself: How do we appreciate that we can both have agency and be disempowered? How can we be gripped by our complicity? Moved by it?

We need to agonize collectively.

My professional life is full of very personal and very political heartbreaks. But I'm certain this is the way it needs to be. Protracted contemplation of our values and our role is the only effective way to engage with something so incredibly immoral. Judith Butler says that our capacity to commit violence, endure it, and be vulnerable to it opens us up to each other. She says that this is what constitutes a political community.

Two years ago, around the start of my work in tech, I facilitated an anti-Blackness in Asian American communities workshop. Afterward, someone came up to ask me some questions. We had a series of conversations. She wanted to bring me in to train her tech company, but leadership turned her down. For about a year, she contemplated her role at her organization and whether it made sense for her. Then, she quit. Later, I received an email asking if I could plug her in to social justice work. She still doesn't work in tech.

To you reading this: don't think of this as a call to action, but a call for reflection. I am asking you and all of us to collectively (perhaps laboriously) agonize over our personal stake in an industry that allows [bodies](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/an-eighth-amazon-warehouse-employee-has-died-from-covid-19/) to be [broken](https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/), that [shreds the fabric of truth](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/how-facebook-continues-to-spread-fake-news) for profit, that decides over and over again that certain people [simply](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/10/22/139639/amazon-is-the-invisible-backbone-behind-ices-immigration-crackdown/) [don't](https://mijente.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WHO%E2%80%99S-BEHIND-ICE_-The-Tech-and-Data-Companies-Fueling-Deportations-_v1.pdf) [matter](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Stern-attitude-toward-tech-industry-emerges-on-SF-13823806.php). I want us to agonize because there may not be a responsible way to live in a world like this and that's something we all need to acknowledge if we're going to create meaningful change.

I am not telling folks to quit their jobs. I'm not quitting, not yet. Instead, I am saying that we need to radically reconsider what working in tech means, whether it's for a month or a year or more. We need to be present for the messy truth, to work through it with our coworkers, and to attend to the agony that comes with it. If for no other reason than this one stated so succinctly by Judith Butler, "We are undone by each other. And if we're not, we're missing something."

## In The News

["He was part of Amazon's coronavirus hiring spree. Two weeks later he was dead."](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-05-27/la-fi-tn-amazon-worker-dead-hiring-wave) Amazon is rapidly hiring new warehouse workers to keep up with consumer demand, but as more and more of its workers die from coronavirus, remaining workers worry that the company is prioritizing profits over worker safety. What's more, the company recently announced that it would be ending [hazard pay](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/13/21256756/amazon-pay-increases-frontline-warehouse-workers-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-may) at the end of the month.

["Facebook reportedly ignored its own research showing algorithms divided users"](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270659/facebook-division-news-feed-algorithms). An internal report from 2016 revealed that "64 percent of people who joined an extremist group on Facebook only did so because the company's algorithm recommended it to them". Facebook's mission statement may be to "bring the world closer together", but it seems to be driving the world apart. We can't rely on unaccountable executives to make good on their vague promises---a company like Facebook will not serve the public good unless it's forced to.

Uber's [quarterly losses](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-eats-grew-like-hell-in-q1-but-ubers-still-lost-nearly-3b/)--which were high even before the pandemic---are now astronomical, and it's decided to lower expenses by [laying off](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/more-uber-layoffs/) another 3,000 employees and closing 45 offices. It's even resorted to scrapping the [electric bikes](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgx8jb/a-shameful-nightmare-truckloads-of-perfectly-good-jump-bikes-are-being-shredded) operated by the micromobility startup it acquired in 2018, to the disappointment of some former employees. As always, such operational decisions are made from the top, rather than by workers, and they will prioritize shareholder value over the common good.

Earlier this month, _Logic Magazine_ published an essay called ['The Making of the Tech Worker Movement'](https://logicmag.io/the-making-of-the-tech-worker-movement/full-text/) by Ben Tarnoff. The piece features quotes from several TWC activists on why they personally care about worker organizing in tech. One volunteer, who became politicized during a union drive among service workers at his workplace, says "[t]he cafeteria worker campaign opened my eyes and made me realize that a union is just a group of workers making demands together [...] I talked to workers about what better wages and benefits would mean to them and their families, and there was no way I could not want that for them." The essay also helps place recent worker actions in the broader political and economic context: as one volunteer says, "we understand that we do have a strategic position with regard to our place in production that we can leverage to stand in solidarity with other workers".

## In History

We're so used to corporations being governed hierarchically and driven by the profit motive that it's easy to forget the possibility of alternatives. The Lucas Plan, proposed by British aerospace industry workers in the 1970s, is one such alternative. As Dave King writes in [The Lucas Plan---An Idea Whose Time has Come?](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/vol22-2/the-new-lucas-plan/) for _Science for the People_:

> Normally referred to as The Lucas Plan, the Alternative Corporate Plan emerged from the industrial and political struggles of the 1970s and almost uniquely, was a practical enactment of the ideas of radical science, not by university-based radical academics, but by working-class industrial workers. Faced with expected job cuts, a Shop Stewards' Combine Committee took a different approach to conventional trade union tactics for resisting them: they asked shop floor workers for their ideas for socially useful products that they could make, which would allow the company to diversify away from its core business of fighter aircraft components. The resulting Alternative Corporate Plan created a worldwide sensation, leading many other groups of industrial workers to follow suit, and a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.
