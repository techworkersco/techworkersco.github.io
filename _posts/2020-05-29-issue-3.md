# An Invitation to Agonize

My mom calls me a protest baby. She’s a refugee who realized early that the only way to get what your community needs is to fight for it. As her only child, I banked a lifetime attending marches, [publishing](http://www.thirdwomanpress.com/) queer feminist writing, and organizing community [schools](https://vietunity.wordpress.com/hai-ba-trung/) that teach activists how to canvass and campaign. I planned to spend my professional life teaching, [writing](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/transformative-justice-explained) about, and building movements that resist the alchemy of racism and capitalism. But two years ago, after UC Berkeley fastened the magical letters Ph.D to the end of my name, I floundered. Facing high housing costs, endless student loan payments, and a saturated academic job market, I made a choice: I came back to anti-oppression [consulting](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-tran-ph-d-546439a9) and expanded my client base to include tech.

I’ve had my practice for twelve years. When I started, we called it “cultural literacy training.” Then it became “anti-oppression work.” Now, a lot of what I do falls under the umbrella of “diversity, equity and inclusion.” On a daily basis, I am in rooms asking marginalized employees what makes it hard for them to do their work. Amidst the smell of stale coffee and bad carpet, a trans employee of color might tell me that they’re tokenized by their manager. A common refrain is, “My white managers have no idea how to receive feedback from people that look like me.” I fill these gaps with allyship trainings and by writing progressive employee policies. I troubleshoot other problems with pipelines and workplace culture. Over more than a decade, my good days have been defined by a combination of curiosity and humility. The best ones include someone asking me, “What should I do when I’m inadvertently racist?” There are also bad days.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion is a crowded field. It mainly consists of lawyers, human resource managers, and other corporate professionals. In my experience, only a small handful of these folks have either a deep well of knowledge or a commitment to uprooting systemic causes of oppression. This is why many focus on expanding recruiting pools or bettering their respective brands instead of dismantling capitalism. And because tech traffics in transplants, even fewer have felt the pain associated with the churn of their industry in the Bay Area. But I have.

I grew up in a part of San Jose called Alum Rock, 17 minutes away from the Apple Campus in Cupertino. Asian supermarkets sit next to taquerias, Vietnamese sandwich shops and tiny storefronts selling tofu. Everyone kind of looks like me, Southeast Asian or brown. Most folks are trying to make it. Despite being only thirteen miles away from Apple, no one in my family of over forty people has ever worked there. Here, hating tech is a religion and I am a devout follower. Tech is a dirty word, a euphemism for gentrification and poverty; the rationale for a lot of people’s pain. I [write](https://rewire.news/article/2017/10/24/neighbors-look-like-alien-women-gentrification/) about it, I [tweet](https://twitter.com/but_im_kim_tran/status/1259207531982811137) about it, and I often talk about [Google’s aggressive expansion](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Google-proposes-master-plan-for-San-Jose-14511528.php) in a town where home values average [$1.13 million](https://www.zillow.com/research/hottest-housing-markets-2018-17852/) and rent for a studio [hovers above $2,000 per month](https://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/most-expensive-cities-for-renters/). On bad days, I remember my hometown and struggle to imagine how helping tech diversify its employee base, or decrease microaggressions, is anything other than putting lipstick on a pig.

I often feel trapped by my job.

The organizer in me knows I’m not doing enough to address the root causes of oppression; that my sheer existence assuages the liberal guilt associated with tech. On the other hand, I offer a slightly more level playing field: a voice for the people who are always spoken over in a meeting, passed over for a promotion, invited for an interview. I am making the workplace a little better for queer people of color like me.

So. How do I reconcile years studying the pernicious effects of racial capitalism, only to become a part of the machine that disenfranchises my community? How do I reconcile fighting how tech harms people with taking its paychecks? How do I reconcile a lifetime spent hating tech with seeing an actual billionaire face to face? The short answer: I don’t.

For two years I have agonized over my involvement with tech. I have sat with and opened myself up to the harm that I've caused. I do not write myself off as privileged, or denigrate myself as powerless within late capitalism. Both are reductive ways to dismiss how power actually operates. Instead, I’ve asked myself: How do we appreciate that we can both have agency and be disempowered? How can we be gripped by our complicity? Moved by it?

We need to agonize collectively.

My professional life is full of very personal and very political heartbreaks. But I’m certain this is the way it needs to be. Protracted contemplation of our values and our role is the only effective way to engage with something so incredibly immoral. Judith Butler says that our capacity to commit violence, endure it, and be vulnerable to it opens us up to each other. She says that this is what constitutes a political community.

Two years ago, around the start of my work in tech, I facilitated an anti-Blackness in Asian American communities workshop. Afterward, someone came up to ask me some questions. We had a series of conversations. She wanted to bring me in to train her tech company, but leadership turned her down. For about a year, she contemplated her role at her organization and whether it made sense for her. Then, she quit. Later, I received an email asking if I could plug her in to social justice work. She still doesn’t work in tech.

To you reading this: don’t think of this as a call to action, but a call for reflection. I am asking you and all of us to collectively (perhaps laboriously) agonize over our personal stake in an industry that allows [bodies](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/an-eighth-amazon-warehouse-employee-has-died-from-covid-19/) to be [broken](https://www.revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/), that shreds the fabric of [truth](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/how-facebook-continues-to-spread-fake-news) for profit, that decides over and over again that certain people [simply](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/10/22/139639/amazon-is-the-invisible-backbone-behind-ices-immigration-crackdown/) [don’t](https://mijente.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WHO%E2%80%99S-BEHIND-ICE_-The-Tech-and-Data-Companies-Fueling-Deportations-_v1.pdf) [matter](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Stern-attitude-toward-tech-industry-emerges-on-SF-13823806.php). I want us to agonize because there may not be a responsponsible way to live in a world like this and that’s something we all need to acknowledge if we’re going to create meaningful change.

I am not telling folks to quit their jobs. I’m not quitting, not yet. Instead, I am saying that we need to radically reconsider what working in tech means, whether it's for a month or a year or more. We need to be present for the messy truth, to work through it with our coworkers, and to attend to the agony that comes with it. If for no other reason than this one stated so succinctly by Judith Butler, “We are undone by each other. And if we’re not, we’re missing something.”

_And I'll rise up_<br/>
