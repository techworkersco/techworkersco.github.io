Our goal in this newsletter is mutual aid, tech workers for tech workers. The most valuable, enjoyable part of our process is talking with fellow workers; the stories we publish are a bonus. 

Now, we’re inviting you to talk with fellow workers too. To get perspective and get organized. To have a safe and trusting space with people who are not in the same workplace but may have been in a similar situation. To leverage years of experience among allies in labor and tech.

[Sign up to give or get peer support](https://airtable.com/shra11xhyCiTOt7xZ).

We’ll reach out next week to talk with you about mutual aid. There's more coming this spring, including an intergenerational teach-in event that builds on our series about Black workers and organizing at IBM. If you want an invitation, or want to collaborate on anything else, sign up and let us know.
