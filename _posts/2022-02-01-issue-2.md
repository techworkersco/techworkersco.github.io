Our goal in this newsletter is mutual aid, tech workers for tech workers. The most valuable, enjoyable part of our process is talking with fellow workers – the stories we publish are a bonus. 

Now, we invite you to talk with fellow workers too. To have a safe and trusting space with people in different workplaces but similar situatiions. To leverage experience among allies in labor and tech. To get perspective and get organized.

**[Sign up to give or get peer support](https://airtable.com/shra11xhyCiTOt7xZ)**. 

We’ll reach out next week to start the process. And this spring, we're organizing an intergenerational teach-in that builds on [our series](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2021/06/19/issue-13/) about the IBM Black Workers Alliance. If you want an invitation, or want to collaborate on anything else, sign up and let us know.
