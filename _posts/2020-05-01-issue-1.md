Today is May Day, also known as International Workers Day or [#EssentialWorkersDay](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EssentialWorkersDay&src=typeahead_click). As shelter-in-place orders are extended in the Bay Area and beyond, it becomes increasingly clear just how much society relies on those who are unable to ‘shelter in place’: those working in supermarkets, or Amazon warehouses, or delivering goods to people’s homes. But even as their employers are celebrated for providing services to people in need, these frontline workers are rarely granted the respect they deserve -- not to mention the wages, benefits, or even protective equipment.

<!-- excerpt -->

For many workers, the situation is intolerable, and they are taking a stand. Today, workers at Instacart, Shipt, Amazon warehouses, and your neighborhood Whole Foods are striking with a [list of demands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KD8uaVch14xBD1TTZ-TKbAub-IcqERS6O1OVeL2HbtY/edit). Christian Smalls, Amazon warehouse worker and organizer who was fired earlier this month, shared a [video montage](https://twitter.com/Shut_downAmazon/status/1255681771292721158) featuring dozens of essential workers who are walking out to protest for better working conditions.

## THE WORKER’S PERSPECTIVE

There’s no other way to say it: solidarity is a struggle. 

Today, on May Day, what can any of us do to help our fellow workers win their demands? It’s a complicated question for any of us, [even in our own neighborhoods](https://itsgoingdown.org/autonomous-groups-are-mobilizing-mutual-aid-initiatives-to-combat-the-coronavirus/). It’s one thing to share mask-wearing tips, [DIY PPE resources](https://diyppe.us/), or even a [list of grants for artists](https://www.booooooom.com/2020/03/20/covid-19-resources-for-artists/). It’s another thing to commit to working through things, together, especially with distances and divides between our communities and workplaces. The Reveal’s recent [podcast](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/pandemic-protests-and-profits/) on COVID-19 in Amazon warehouses quotes one anonymous worker as saying, “Until Amazon and Jeff Bezos starts realizing there's real people that are going to die in his warehouse, that's not going to stop. And we need the customers to speak up. We can't do it alone.” That includes us, too.

A handful of volunteer organizers in TWC have been talking with a collective of Instacart shoppers about ways to show our support. [Restarting this newsletter](/about/) is one small way to organize ourselves in response. (You can subscribe [here](/subscribe/)!) But it’s not easy to put pressure on some of the wealthiest companies in the world to treat their frontline workers better. One way tech workers and allies might be able to provide material support is by helping to simplify the process of [applying](https://www.wired.com/story/gig-workers-unemployment-benefits-wont-come-quickly/) for unemployment insurance. Another is to pressure tech companies -- especially gig economy companies -- to pay their workers what they’re owed, instead of allocating $110 million to fund a [counter-proposal](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/04/protesting-uber-and-lyft-drivers-want-back-pay-and-more-coronavirus-protections/) that will almost definitely make things [worse](http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-uber-lyft-ballot-initiative-guarantees-only-5-64-an-hour/). This is why we need to stay in the struggle, together.

## IN THE NEWS

## IN HISTORY

What is a gig, and where did it come from? In Italy, the freelancer network [Doc Servici](https://www.docservizi.it/) likes to say that musicians are the original gig workers, playing gigs for tips. In Malaysia, the arrival of Grab and Uber got half-hearted [sympathy](https://www.quora.com/Do-you-pity-the-Malaysian-taxi-drivers-who-lose-their-income-to-Uber-and-Grabcar-drivers-in-Malaysia) from users who acknowledged the poor driver pay and conditions, but just couldn’t see beyond a cheap and easy ride. 

Solidarity with all gig workers and independent contractors gets complicated when customers enjoy what they get without paying the full cost. But no matter the current benefits for customers, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the situation for workers is untenable. As these companies increase in size and stature, worker pay continues to decline, demonstrating that the promised “innovation” was directed primarily towards exploiting workers. it’s clear that something has to change. As Veena Dubal, Associate Professor of law at U.C. Hastings, writes in [A Brief History of the Gig](https://logicmag.io/security/a-brief-history-of-the-gig/) the upcoming issue of _Logic Magazine_:

> Samy, an Iranian refugee who emigrated to California in the 2000s, described the terrible conditions that he and many of these “independent contractors” face. Unable to afford the Bay Area, he lives a hundred miles away from San Francisco, and rather than commute to the city daily, he sleeps in his car between shifts, sometimes not returning home for several days in a row. “We have no freedom,” he told me. “I sleep in my car. I eat in my car. I work in my car. That is not freedom. That is not flexibility.”

## IN SONG

We have not one but two (2!!) songs for you:

### [Iceage - Lockdown Blues](https://iceage.bandcamp.com/track/lockdown-blues)

_Your river flows again, my love_  
_I know you've been choked_  
_A loosened clamp around your beak_  
_While crowds and parties mock the weak_

_A sudden fatal tenant_  
_Seizes room_  
_Didn't grasp what I had until_  
_It was robbed absent too soon_

Says the band, “All profits from Bandcamp will proceed directly to Médecins Sans Frontières who right now are doing their best to provide aid where it so urgently is needed the most.”

### [GmacCash - On Strike (Shot By DaPoundMedia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJOHvQ9cL38)

_We goin’ on strike (strike)_  
_We goin’ on strike (all day)_  
_We goin’ on strike (all night)_  
_‘Till they get this shit right._

_We goin’ on strike so you better listen_  
_We ain’t bout to keep workin’ under these conditions_  
_Working in a hot plant with no air conditioning (it’s hot as hell)_  
_And they got the nerve to tell us that there’s fair conditions (yeah right)_

_If they don’t work they ass off, they gonna get fired_  
_Temps workin’ like slaves and don’t get hired_  
_The supervisor don’t care if they get tired (they don’t)_  
_They just trying to make sure them sales get higher (keep goin’)_
