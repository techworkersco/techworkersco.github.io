Last week, Sharon Goen of [Gig Workers Collective](https://twitter.com/GigWC) in Las Vegas told her story and presented [five demands to fix on-demand shopping](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2021/11/02/issue-23/). This week, we’re back to songs: Oakland punk band The Strange Ones released a single written in support of gig workers and is matching all sales in a donation to GWC. Today is the last day to get the track and support GWC. Buy it for $1 on Bandcamp [here](https://wearethestrangeones.bandcamp.com/track/inside-out).

Also, if you know anyone who works on the corporate side of Instacart, send them Sharon's story - it’s free advice from shoppers who talked it out, did the math, and spelled out their demands.
