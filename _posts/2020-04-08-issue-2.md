[Tracy Chapman, Talkin' About A Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv8FBjo1Y8I)

*While they're standing in the welfare lines*

*Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation*

*Wasting time in unemployment lines*

*Sitting around waiting for a promotion*

*Don't you know you're talking about a revolution*

*It sounds like a whisper*
